# Electron Weather App
---
A simple weather app to play around with a learn the [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) app framework. I utilize the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/) and the [Google Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) to location and weather info.
